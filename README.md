## What is about
1. A List of restaurants nearby you that you can vote in which one you want to lunch.
1. It gets a list from Yelp. 
1. You can vote where you want to lunch and other people around you will see it.

## Plataform and language
1. Android plataform. 
1. Minimum requirements:
  1. MinSdkVersion 19
  1. GPS
  1. Internet connection

## Highlights
1. It has some limitations due it stores data in a free server and the data is KEY VALUE format. It was a big challenge to make it work properly.
1. It grabs your phone ID so I can say you are unique
1. It works without **ANY CONFIGURATION**. YESSSSS
1. Another goal is to make it work **WITHOUT MONEY**. No paid server nor databases.

## Need to improve
1. Tests, always.
1. UI. I am not the best in UI coding but this is ugly AF.
