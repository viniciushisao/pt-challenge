## What is about
1. A List of restaurants nearby you that you can vote in which one you want to lunch.
1. It gets a list from Yelp. 
1. You can vote where you want to lunch and other people around you will see it.

## Plataform and language
1. Android plataform. 
1. Minimum requirements:
  1. MinSdkVersion 19
  1. GPS
  1. Internet connection

## Highlights
1. It has some limitations due it stores data in a free server and the data is KEY VALUE format. It was a big challenge to make it work properly.
1. It grabs your phone ID so I can say you are unique
1. It works without **ANY CONFIGURATION**. YESSSSS
1. Another goal is to make it work **WITHOUT MONEY**. No paid server nor databases.
1. I used as reference the [sample codes](https://github.com/viniciushisao/android_classes) I have when I am teaching Android. 

## Need to improve
1. Tests, always.
1. UI. I am not the best in UI coding but this is ugly AF.

## Challenges
1. Learn a little bit of Retrofit (in all  my projects I implemented HTTP requests or I didn`t work on network)
1. Persist data in the internet without paying
1. I needed to update my sample codes, since some stuff was not right!
